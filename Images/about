Figure 1. Annual variation in total monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and CRP. Data are mean (bars) and 95%
confidence intervals (boxes), with fitted cosinor curves (dotted line). Daylength is indicated by the box color
gradients

Figure 2. Daytime variation in monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and CRP. Data are mean (bars) and 95%
confidence intervals (boxes), with fitted segmented regression lines (dotted black lines). The color gradient
represents mean zenith angle of the sun at each time point is given to indicate daylight
