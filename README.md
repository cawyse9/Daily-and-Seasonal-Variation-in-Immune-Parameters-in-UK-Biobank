## Background
Seasonal disease outbreaks are perennial features of human infectious disease but the factors generating these patterns are unclear. 

## Objective
Here we investigate seasonal and daytime variability in multiple immune parameters in 329,261 participants in UK Biobank and test for associations with a wide range of environmental and lifestyle factors, including changes in day length, outdoor temperature and vitamin D at the time the blood sample was collected. 

## Results
Seasonal patterns were evident in lymphocyte and neutrophil counts, and C-reactive protein CRP, but not monocytes, and these were independent of lifestyle, demographic, and environmental factors. All the immune parameters assessed demonstrated significant daytime variation that was independent of confounding factors. At a population level, human immune parameters vary across season and across time of day, independent of multiple confounding factors. Both season and time of day are fundamental dimensions of immune function that should be considered in all studies of immuno-prophylaxis and disease transmission.
