## Background
Circulating white blood cell counts are known to oscillate across days and seasons under basal conditions, reflecting distribution of cells between tissues and the periphery. Importantly, daily rhythms persist in constant conditions and are absent in animals with ablated clock function, indicating that they are mediated via innate circadian timing mechanisms. The extensive data collection within UK Biobank represents an unprecedented opportunity to assess seasonal and time-of-day and seasonal variation in levels of human immune parameters. 

## Objective
The aim of this project is to investigate seasonal and daytime variability in multiple immune parameters in 329,261 participants in UK Biobank while adjusting for a wide range of environmental and lifestyle factors, including changes in day length, outdoor temperature and vitamin D at the time the blood sample was collected. 

## Results
Seasonal patterns were evident in lymphocyte and neutrophil counts, and C-reactive protein CRP, but not monocytes, and these were independent of lifestyle, demographic, and environmental factors. All the immune parameters assessed demonstrated significant daytime variation that was independent of confounding factors. At a population level, human immune parameters vary across season and across time of day, independent of multiple confounding factors. Both season and time of day are fundamental dimensions of immune function that should be considered in all studies of immuno-prophylaxis and disease transmission.
